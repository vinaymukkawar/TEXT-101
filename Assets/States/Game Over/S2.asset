  storyText: 'You take what feels like an eternity to scrounge a rock flinger and
    3 vials of tonix. When a huge machine cog lands an arm span from your head you
    decide its time to make your dash.


    You scramble aboard your airship. With
    all of your remaining strength, you lift the anchoring rope off its huge hook
    and give an all mighty shove.


    From behind you hear a surprised crew member.
    He rushes. You shoot. Direct hit. Thank goodness for the weapon. You''re safe.
    For now.


    1. Continue...'
